World Clock XL is an HTML5 Canvas-based clock simulation that visualizes the time in multiple time zones as multiple clocks. World Clock XL is a free, open source, cross-platform, browser-based application that runs on any modern browser. It is written in plain vanilla JavaScript and uses no external libraries. Heck, if you download it, you can even run it locally on your computer in a web browser without a web server.

World Clock XL is also an HTML5 Canvas tutorial that demonstrates how to create animations, repond to window and user events, how to draw shapes and text, and how to use the JavaScript Date object to get the current time in multiple time zones.

World Clock XL is a composed of a simple set of 3 files (.js, .html. .css) that you can use as a starting point for your own projects. A hosted version of World Clock XL is available at [https://www.pavley.com/demos/world-clock/](pavley.com).

World Clock XL was written with the help of Github Copilot, an AI that suggests code based on the context of your code. For the beginner Copilot is both a boon and curse. For the more experienced, it is a boon. (That last sentense was suggested by Copilot.)
